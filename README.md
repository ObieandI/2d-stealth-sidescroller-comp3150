# 2D Stealth Platformer â€“ COMP3150 Major Project

A Unity-based 2D side-scrolling stealth platformer developed as part of the COMP3150 Game Development unit at Macquarie University. This project emphasizes enemy evasion, exploration, and player learning through iterative gameplay design.

## About the Game

Players control a small mammal navigating forest environments filled with hidden dangers, including patrolling dogs and birds. The game challenges players to find hidden life pickups, master tree-based movement, and adapt to unique enemy behaviors.

## Technologies Used

- **Game Engine:** Unity
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **Scripting:** C# (Visual Studio Code)
- **Design Tools:** Photoshop, Tilemap Editor
- **Collaboration Tools:** Discord, Google Drive, Zoom

## My Role

I contributed across the full development cycle with a primary focus on:

- **Level Design:** Created and iterated tree-based layouts, hidden paths, and enemy encounters.
- **Playtesting Lead:** Designed playtest plans, conducted remote playtests via Zoom, recorded and analyzed feedback.
- **QA & Bug Reporting:** Identified gameplay bugs (e.g., AI bin loop), documented them clearly, and worked with the programmer to resolve them.
- **Balancing:** Tuned player and enemy movement to encourage specific gameplay strategies (e.g., favoring tree traversal).
- **Sound Design:** Sourced and implemented gameplay SFX and BGM.
- **Tilemap Customization:** Created 15+ custom tiles for visual and navigational variety.

## Challenges Faced

- **AI Behavior Bugs:** Fixed frustrating enemy behaviors, including a looping patrol bug with the stealth bin mechanic.
- **Communication Gaps:** Faced early misunderstandings regarding role responsibilities. Resolved this by improving documentation and clarifying roles within the team.
- **Level Complexity:** Balancing challenge and exploration without overwhelming players was a core challenge, especially during iterative playtest feedback.
- **Tool Frustrations:** Ran into performance issues with Unity tilemaps and workflow friction with Photoshop.

## Key Learnings

- **Player-Centered Design:** Iterative playtesting and observation shaped many of the core design decisions.
- **Team Collaboration:** Learned the importance of clear role definitions and respectful, proactive communication.
- **Agile Practices:** Regular milestones and feedback cycles improved our responsiveness and delivery.
- **Technical Adaptability:** Gained hands-on experience managing assets, resolving bugs, and using Git collaboratively.
